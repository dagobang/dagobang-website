    "q1": {
      "question": "Does Dagobang custody my assets or private keys?",
      "answer": "No. We do not touch your private keys. All assets and signatures are managed by your browser wallet. The security model is consistent with mainstream wallet plugins."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What are the fees for Dagobang?",
      "answer": "The plugin fee is in the 0.1% range. You also need to pay on-chain Gas and DEX protocol fees."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Is silent signing really safe?",
      "answer": "Silent signing can significantly reduce interruptions and improve experience, but it also reduces manual confirmation steps. Please use it only after confirming the reliability of the installation package source, fully understanding the working principle, and trusting this plugin."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is Dagobang an official plugin of a chart site?",
      "answer": "No. Dagobang is an independently developed third-party tool and has no official cooperation or affiliation with any chart platform."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Why support custom privacy RPC?",
      "answer": "Custom privacy RPC can avoid all requests being concentrated on public nodes, reducing the risk of rate limiting, monitoring, or front-running, while improving stability and response speed under high-frequency trading. You can also continue to use the default RPC without any modification."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Which chains are currently supported?",
      "answer": "The current version mainly supports BSC chain trading. Solana is the next chain we prioritize in our plan and will be launched gradually in subsequent versions."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Why can trades be sent without a popup confirmation?",
      "answer": "After you enter your password and unlock the wallet inside the extension, the decrypted key temporarily resides in your browser's memory. In scenarios where silent signing is enabled, Dagobang uses this key locally to sign transactions without opening a popup for every single one, trading one layer of confirmation for faster execution. You can lock the extension at any time or revoke its permissions in your wallet to clear the key from memory and return to a popup based flow."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "How should I configure custom RPC endpoints?",
      "answer": "In the extension settings, enter one RPC URL per line. It is recommended to mix endpoints from different providers, for example a combination of public and paid nodes, and to prioritize official or reputable providers you trust. This helps balance speed, stability and privacy instead of relying on a single crowded public endpoint."

    "intro": "The Dagobang browser extension (\"the Extension\") is provided by the Dagobang team. The Extension is designed around the principles of least privilege and non‑custodial architecture. We do not collect or upload any personally identifiable information.",
    "section1": {

      "body": "The Extension does not collect your name, email, phone number or other personal identity information. It does not collect your browsing history, search queries, chat content or similar personal content, and it does not collect device fingerprints, advertising identifiers or other cross‑site tracking identifiers. The Extension does not upload user data to servers controlled by us, nor do we sell or share user data with third parties."
    },
    "section2": {
      "title": "2. Local storage and on‑chain data",
      "body": "To provide its functionality, the Extension stores certain information in your browser's local storage that is directly related to your use, such as plugin configuration (network selection, gas presets, slippage parameters, RPC settings, etc.), encrypted wallet key material (for example, encrypted private keys), and UI preferences (floating window position, notification placement, etc.). This data is stored only on your local device and is used solely to provide the Extension's functionality and improve your experience. We cannot access this data. Any on‑chain transaction records you create through the Extension (such as transaction hashes, addresses and amounts) are stored on the blockchain itself and can be viewed by anyone via block explorers. This is an inherent property of public ledgers and is not data collected or controlled by us."

      "title": "3. Third‑party services",

    },
    "section4": {
      "title": "4. Data sharing and commercial use",
      "body": "We do not sell, rent or commercially exploit user data to any third party. The Extension does not run ads, does not perform remarketing and does not build user profiles, nor do we use data for any purposes unrelated to enabling on‑chain trading functionality."
    },
    "section5": {
      "title": "5. Security and risk notice",
      "body": "Please keep your device, browser and wallet environment secure, and never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone. If you obtain the Extension from unofficial sources, there may be a risk of tampering; always ensure that your download source is trustworthy. The Extension is a browser‑side tool and cannot replace your own judgement and management of your security environment."

        "0": "Non‑custodial local encryption is the same: both Dagobang and MetaMask encrypt your seed and keys locally and never upload them to a server, deriving the encryption key from your password.",
        "1": "Unlocked keys live briefly in memory: for both MetaMask and Dagobang, once you unlock the wallet the browser process temporarily holds a plaintext key to sign transactions. If the device is already compromised by malware, no hot wallet can offer perfect protection.",
        "2": "The real difference is in interaction: MetaMask usually prompts you with a confirmation window for each transaction, while Dagobang uses silent signing in agreed scenarios after you unlock, reducing popups and better fitting fast, high‑frequency trading."
      },
      "summary": "In short: for local encryption and non‑custodial design Dagobang is comparable to MetaMask. What primarily determines your risk is how clean your device is, how you manage approvals and how much capital you keep in hot wallets."
